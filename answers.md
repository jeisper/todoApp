1. Explain using code examples what is meant by props and state in
   React JS?

Props and state are both mechanisms to manage data in a React component. Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, while state is used to manage data inside the given component itself.
Here is an example of how props are used in a React component:
Class ExampleComponent extends React.Component {
render() {
return <div>{this.props.message}</div>;
}
}

<ExampleComponent message="Hello World" />
In this example, the message prop is being passed to the MyComponent component from its parent component. The MyComponent component then accesses the message prop through this.props.message and uses it to render the text "Hello World" inside a div element.
Here is an example of how state is used in a React component:
class ExampleComponentextends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

handleClick() {
setState({
count: state.count + 1,
});
}

render() {
return (
<div>
<button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Click Me!</button>
<div>{state.count}</div>
</div>
);
}
}
In this example, the MyComponent component has a state object that contains a count property, which is initially set to 0. The component also has a handleClick method that updates the count property in the component's state object whenever the button is clicked. Finally, the component renders the current value of the count property in the div below the button.

2. In functional programming, what does the term functor mean? Can you give
   an example in JavaScript?

In functional programming, a functor is a data type that represents a function or computation that can be applied to a value. In other words, a functor is a type of data structure that can be "mapped" over, meaning that a function can be applied to the values contained within the functor.
Here is an example of a functor in JavaScript
const arrayExample = [10, 20, 30];
const doubledValues = arrayFunctor.map(x => x \* 2);

console.log(doubledValues); // [20, 40, 60]

In this example, the arrayExample is a functor that contains the values 10, 20, and 30. We use the map method to apply a function that doubles each value in the functor, resulting in a new functor with the values 20, 40, and 60.
Functors are commonly used in functional programming languages because they provide a way to apply functions to values in a predictable and composable way. This can make it easier to write and reason about code, particularly when dealing with complex data structures.

3. We have looked at three kinds of asynchronous programming mechanisms,
   namely callbacks, promises and streams. Mention one advantage and one
   disadvantage of each type.

Callbacks - It is a common mechanism for performing asynchronous operations in programming languages. One advantage of using callbacks is that they are widely supported, and can be used in a variety of situations. A disadvantage of using callbacks is that they can lead to "callback hell" â€“ a situation where code becomes difficult to read and maintain due to a large number of nested callbacks.
Promises -It is another mechanism for performing asynchronous operations, and offers a number of advantages over callbacks. One advantage of using promises is that they make it easier to write asynchronous code that is easy to read and maintain, by allowing you to use the then and catch methods to handle asynchronous results. A disadvantage of using promises is that they can be somewhat more complex to work with than callbacks, particularly for developers who are new to asynchronous programming.
Streams - It is a powerful mechanism for working with large amounts of data in an asynchronous way. One advantage of using streams is that they allow you to process data as it is being received, rather than having to wait for all of the data to be received before starting to process it. A disadvantage of using streams is that they can be more difficult to work with than other asynchronous programming mechanisms, and require a deeper understanding of how they work in order to use them effectively.

4. With the aid of a diagram and example code, describe the Cascading Style
   Sheets (CSS) Box Model and show how it can be used to space DOM
   elements.

The CSS Box Model is a concept that describes how the dimensions of a web page element are calculated. It defines the space around an element, including margins, borders, and padding, and how they affect the size and position of the element on the page.
Here is a diagram of the CSS Box Model:
+--------------------------------------------+
| margin |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
| | border | |
| | +---------------------------------+ | |
| | | padding | | |
| | | +---------------------------+ | | |
| | | | content | | | |
| | | +---------------------------+ | | |
| | +---------------------------------+ | |
| +---------------------------------------+ |
+--------------------------------------------+

In this diagram, the content area represents the actual content of the element, such as text or an image. The padding area represents the space between the content and the border of the element. The border area represents the line around the edge of the element. And the margin area represents the space outside of the border.
The dimensions of an element in the CSS Box Model are calculated by adding up the width and height of each of these areas. For example, if an element has a width of 50 pixels and a padding of 5 pixels on each side, the total width of the element will be 60 pixels (50 pixels + 5 pixels + 5 pixels).
Here is an example of how the CSS Box Model can be used to space DOM elements:
.element {
width: 50px;
padding: 5px;
margin: 10px;
}
In this CSS code, the .element class defines a width of 50 pixels, a padding of 5 pixels, and a margin of 10 pixels. When applied to a DOM element, this class will cause the element to have a total width of 80 pixels (50 pixels + 5 pixels + 5 pixels + 10 pixels + 10 pixels).
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web development, and is used extensively to control the layout and spacing of elements on a web page.

5. Detail how the browser loads and bootstraps a rich web application from an
   initial URL.

When a user enters a URL into their web browser, it begins a series of steps to load and bootstrap the corresponding web application. These steps can be broadly divided into the following phases:
The browser parses the URL and sends a request to the web server for the corresponding web page.
The web server receives the request and responds with the HTML for the web page.
The browser receives the HTML and begins to parse it, constructing a DOM.
As the browser parses the HTML, it may encounter references to other resources, such as stylesheets, images, or scripts. For each of these resources, the browser sends a separate request to the server to retrieve the resource.
The browser continues to parse the HTML and construct the DOM tree until it reaches the end of the HTML document. At this point, the browser has a complete representation of the web page in memory, but the page is not yet interactive or functional.
The browser begins to execute the JavaScript code in the page, which may manipulate the DOM, add event listeners, and perform other operations to make the page interactive.
Once all of the JavaScript has been executed and the page is fully interactive, the browser emits a "load" event to indicate that the page is ready for user interaction.
At this point, the web application has been loaded and bootstrapped, and the user can begin interacting with it. The exact details of this process may vary depending on the specific web application and the technologies it uses, but the general steps outlined above are common to most web applications.
